    <description>If you're bored of psychopathic cannibal slave trading colonies, how about going to the complete opposite end of the spectrum with some tree hugging hippies!
	
This mod introduces the vegan and vegetarian traits to drive you up the wall and around the bend with their picky eating and their protests about wearing dead animals.

The less dedicated vegetarians will just complain about eating meat and helping you butcher, but the vegans will protest all animal products.

Your treehuggers just want you to stop exploiting animals. Is that really so much to ask?

This is Rimworld, after all. So realistically, you're probably just going to farm them to feed your cannibals "vegan food".
